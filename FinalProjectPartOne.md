# Data
I located the data that I am using for this project using the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. The dataset I am working with, “Allegheny County Crash Data,” was uploaded by PennDOT and is updated annually. I will use the most recent year available (2018). The dataset includes over 160 fields recording factors and outcomes related to each reportable accident. (“Reportable accident” refers to an incident on a road open to the public that involved at least one motor vehicle in transport and resulted in at least one of the following outcomes: injury to any person; death of any person; or damage to any vehicle to the extent that it cannot be driven under its own power in its customary manner without further damage or hazard to the vehicle, other traffic elements, or the roadway, and therefore requires towing.)

I created a copy of the data to remove blank records and to evaluate and select, with help from the accompanying background information and data dictionary, which fields would be of most interest to my work. I translated the columns including “Yes” and “No” responses into “1” or “0” to create data that I could use in calculations. I used these fields and those that were already in numerical format to calculate aggregate figures for each field to identify totals for categories like total fatalities and total injuries, which would help me to understand the landscape surrounding this subject area. I then added a column that would identify if at least one of the behaviors included in the analysis was a factor in each crash, and another that would identify how many of the total behaviors were a factor in each crash. I plan to add additional analysis as needed as I construct the story.

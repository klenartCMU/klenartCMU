# Data
I located the data that I am using for this project using the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. The dataset I am working with, “Allegheny County Crash Data,” was uploaded by PennDOT and is updated annually. I will use the most recent year available (2018). The dataset includes over 160 fields recording factors and outcomes related to each reportable accident. (“Reportable accident” refers to an incident on a road open to the public that involved at least one motor vehicle in transport and resulted in at least one of the following outcomes: injury to any person; death of any person; or damage to any vehicle to the extent that it cannot be driven under its own power in its customary manner without further damage or hazard to the vehicle, other traffic elements, or the roadway, and therefore requires towing.)

So far, I have cleaned the data and narrowed its scope to the fields most of interest to me. This included translating various "Yes"/"No" columns into indicator columns, combining information from several columns to create an aggregate indicator, and creating aggregate columns and rows to identify totals for categories like fatalities and injuries, total number of factors involved, etc. I have also started sorting the data I will need for each visualization into separate tabs to help keep the number of fields manageable for each component. I anticipate additional work with the data will be necessary as I perform further analysis and develop the visualizations.

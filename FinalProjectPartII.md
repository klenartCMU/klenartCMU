# User Research Protocol

The storyboard for user feedback can be found [here](https://klenartcmu.github.io/klenart_portfolio/FirstStoryboard).

### Target Audience

The target audience I plan to reach with my story is all drivers in Allegheny County.

### Identifying Individuals to Interview

I wanted to interview three Allegheny County drivers to determine the extent to which the story and visualizations conveyed the intended message.

**Background**<br/>

12,417 reportable auto accidents occurred in Allegheny County in 2018. Police reports document several items related to each accident, including characteristics that may have contributed to the incident or affected the outcomes (injuries or fatalities) that resulted. Although factors like weather and illumination affect accident occurrence, other factors encompass risk behaviors like cell phone use, speeding, and driving under the influence, which are under driver control. As a result, one way to reduce accidents and their outcomes is to reduce driver participation in behaviors like these.

**Methods and Metrics**<br/>

•	Five- to ten-minute, in-person interviews with three Pennsylvania drivers of different ages <br/>
•	Notes from these interviews will be analyzed to identify areas improvement to the story and its visualizations

*Introduction*: Thank you for your time today. I’d like to get some feedback from you on a data story about car accidents and driver risk behaviors. I’ll provide you with a storyboard that outlines the basic narrative of the story with the planned visualizations. Many of these visualizations are preliminary sketches of what the final charts and graphs will be. Because of this, I’d ask you to focus on critiquing these visualizations as parts of the narrative, rather than critiquing them as finished graphics.

*Body*: Please review this storyboard and let me know when you’ve read it through.

**Interview Findings**<br/>

I interviewed three local drivers: a 26 year-old female, a 27 year-old female, and a 27 year-old male. I took notes by hand during these interviews, and I have summarized their responses below to highlight some of the areas I plan to address moving forward.

1.	Narrative<br/>
    a.	What message did you get from this story?<br/>
        i.	There are a lot of driver behaviors involved in accidents.<br/>
        ii.	Aggressive or distracted driving can result in accidents.<br/>
        iii.	Being safer while I drive could help avoid accidents.<br/>
    b.	Do you think that any of the “chapters” obscure this message?<br/>
        i.	No<br/>
        ii.	No, but some clarification on the section about the work that could be done might help. It could be framed differently to               demonstrate that it is beyond the scope of this project<br/>
        iii.	No, as long as you add some text to explain the alluvial diagram.<br/>
2.	Visualizations<br/>
    a.	Do you think the visualizations were supportive of the narrative you identified in the previous question?<br/>
        i.	Yes, but I do think the order they were in didn’t necessarily make immediate sense. Maybe that could be clarified.<br/>
        ii.	Yes. The visuals clearly show that there is a correlation between the risk factors and accidents.<br/>
        iii.	Yes, and they cover accident risk and potential outcomes.<br/>
    b.	Do you think any of them are particularly effective to this end?<br/>
        i.	The pie chart – only had to look at it for a split second to understand what it was saying<br/>
        ii.	The pie chart – there are only two categories, so it becomes really clear that vast majority of accidents involve at least               one of the behaviors<br/>
        iii.	The bar graph of risk factors stuck out at me because it shows that aggressive driving is a factor in so many accidents.<br/>
    c.	Do you think any of them detract from this narrative?<br/>
        i.	No.<br/>
        ii.	Don’t know if this is “detracting,” exactly, but the very small portion of the first visual (proportions of accidents                   involving a given number of risk factors) is difficult to read and interpret because some of the percentages are so small.               This made it more difficult to figure out that part of it.<br/>
        iii.	The alluvial diagram is helpful once it’s clear what’s going on. That could use some clarification- labeling and maybe a                 brief explanation of the point, for people who aren’t familiar with that type of graphic.<br/>
3.	Viewer questions based on story<br/>
    a.	What did this story leave you wondering about?<br/>
        i.	The order the graphs – could’ve benefitted from a little more explanation at the start of each section that described what               that chapter’s overall point was to show why the graphs included in that section made that point. Without it, it felt like               the story jumped back and forth from risk factors to fatalities and injuries and back again.<br/>
        ii.	Can’t help but wonder about factors like weather and lighting, even though those were listed as areas of future work.<br/>
        iii.	Precise definitions for some of the terms – would have liked to see some of the behaviors defined that are more                         ambiguous, like “aggressive driving.”<br/>
4.	Personal connection<br/>
    a.	Did anything in this story connect with you personally?<br/>
        i.	“It made me think about some the things I do while I drive, especially using my phone. I know I do it, even though I                     shouldn’t. I noticed a distinction between the risky behaviors that I do while driving, like using my phone, versus those               that I don’t, like being aggressive. It was hard not to check off mentally a few behaviors I know I do as I looked down the list.”<br/>
        ii.	“Working in the legal field, I’ve found it surprising how many DUI cases I’ve seen in progress since I started my career. I             think it’s more common than most people think, and this helps show that this is a problem locally and an unnecessary risk.”<br/>
        iii.	“My mom was is in an accident caused by an unlicensed driver earlier this year. She was ok, but the fact that he was                     unlicensed made things more complicated. It was interesting to see that as a category here, and to think about it as a                   risk factor like cell phone use and driving under the influence.”<br/>
5.	Additional information<br/>
    a.	Are there any additional aspects of the story that you would like to comment on?<br/>
        i.	No.<br/>
        ii.	It might help to clarify the distinction between the two types of variables at the beginning – does “accident outcome” just             refer to injuries and fatalities?<br/>
        iii.	The storyboard was a little cramped at times, but I think creating the final project digitally would correct for that.<br/>

**Changes Resulting from Interviews**<br/>

The updated storyboard I created based on user feedback can be found [here](https://klenartcmu.github.io/klenart_portfolio/SecondStoryboard).<br/>

1.	Clarify terms<br/>
    a.	Include definitions of ambiguous terms, like “aggressive driving” (PennDOT)<br/>
    b.	Clarify that “outcomes” refer to injuries and fatalities<br/>
2.	Clarify the path of the narrative to make the visualizations transition more smoothly.<br/>
    a.	The first set is about the overall landscape of the relationship between risk factors and accidents. The purpose of this                 section is to demonstrate that the vast majority of accidents involve one or more of these risk factors, and that aggression             is by far the most frequent risk factor, followed (at a distance) by speeding and distracted driving.<br/>
    b.	The second set is about tying these risk factors to outcomes (injuries and fatalities). This section demonstrates that                   almost three-quarters of accident fatalities involve one or more of these factors. About three-quarters of injuries with                 known severity result from accidents involving these risk factors.<br/>
    c.	The final graph charts the relationship between accidents, the number of risk factors, and the most severe outcome that                 occurred as a result of that accident. This chart shows that accidents with behavioral risk factors are just as destructive             as those with other factors only.<br/>
3.	To further clarify the path of the narrative, use colors to signal the section of the story. I will also select visualization           colors that will coordinate with the primary color of that section.<br/>
4.	Experiment with another type of visualization for the first graph (proportions of accidents involving each number of factors) or         use an inset to clarify the values for the very small proportions (as with the candidate philanthropy project). Talk to                 Chris/Matt about dealing with this type of issue. (In progress)<br/>
5.  Add text to the alluvial diagram to clarify labels and interpretation. Also, change the text of “0”/“1” for “no                        factors”/“factors” to “no”/“yes.” (In progress, although in looking at my storyboard with fresh eyes, I'm not sure how much this        visualization adds.)<br/>

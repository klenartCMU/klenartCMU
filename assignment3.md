In looking for a visualization to critique and revise for this assignment, I came across an interesting article in Forbes about the charitable contributions of the current field seeking the Democratic nomination for President. The article included a [visualization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2019/08/14/how-charitable-are-the-2020-presidential-candidates/#4bd7c8e625ee) that allowed users to toggle back and forth between two sets of graduated circles: one with circle size based on the total dollar amount a candidate contributed, and another with circle size based on contributions as a percent of that candidate's total earnings.

In reading the article and looking at the visualization, a few strengths and weaknesses jumped out at me right away. Working through Stephen Few's effectiveness profile helped me to perform a more holistic evaluation and identify what worked well and what I could potentially change in a redesign.

The visualization's greatest strengths

At the same time, there were a few aspects of the visualization that I wanted to experiment with.

I started by drafting a series of very basic sketches that took a few different approaches to visualizing the data.

After working on these, I selected the two that I felt were strongest and worked on a more improved, though still very basic, wireframe of the scatter-plot looking draft using Tableau. I met with Matt in Office Hours to get some feedback on

Following this meeting, I also consulted with my roommate to get her perspective as a cold reader on the wireframes. She provided helpful feedback on what was clearest about the proposed design, which helped me identify what would need to be changed or emphasized moving forward.

I used Tableau to develop the proposed redesign further, incorporating the provided feedback to clarify the graph and then making cosmetic adjustments. This included the use of ColorBrewer to obtain a 12-class, categorical color scheme, which, although I edited it slightly to darken the yellow, was very helpful as a tool to make the individual circles identifiable. I ultimately opted for outlined, rather than shaded, circles because so many of the data points at the 1% and 2% lines were congregated close together.

This resulted in a dilemma that I had to work through. What should I do about the crowded lower lefthand corner of the graph? Two of the candidates were actually obscured almost completely at the 1% and 2% marks. I thought about using a break, and looked up how to do it. In the course of reviewing results, I saw a recommendation for William Cleveland's work on full breaks. Long story short(ish), I ended up in a rabbit hole of information on suggestions for portraying this type of data. Through a [blog](https://tomhopper.me/2010/08/30/graphing-highly-skewed-data/), I was introduced to Ed Tufte's "small multiples" idea of presenting a full visualization that encompasses all points followed by secondary graphs that "zoom in" on certain portions of the visualization to clarify what the data is doing in these regions. That suggestion led me to the two-graphic approach to presenting this information, which would allow me to show the entire scope of giving by candidates while maintaining enough detail for viewers to understand what was actually happening in crowded portions of the graph. The full visualization demonstrated that giving among candidates, though variable in dollar amount, was generally similar when calculated as a portion of earnings. The additional graphs allowed for comparison across candidates whose values were more obscured in the broader graph.

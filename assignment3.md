In looking for a visualization to critique and revise for this assignment, I came across an interesting article in Forbes about the charitable contributions of the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for President. The article included a [visualization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2019/08/14/how-charitable-are-the-2020-presidential-candidates/#4bd7c8e625ee) that allowed users to toggle back and forth between two sets of graduated circles each demonstrating an aspect of charitable giving. One based circle size on the total dollar amount a candidate contributed, and the other based circle size on contributions as a percent of that candidate's total earnings.

In reading the article and looking at the visualization, a few strengths and weaknesses jumped out at me right away. Working through Stephen Few's effectiveness profile helped me to perform a more holistic evaluation and identify what worked well and what I could potentially change in a redesign.

I think one of the visualization’s strongest assets is its inclusion of both total dollar amounts donated and donations as a percentage of income, which tells two important dimensions of the story. Additionally, the article addresses key limitations of the data used, including its reliance on tax returns, which may not encompass all giving and eliminates comparison for candidates who haven’t released these documents. This clarifies what the data can tell us and contributes to the visualization’s truthfulness score. The visualization’s current focus, comparing the candidates to one another, is another helpful aspect of the published visualization. This contrasts with the article’s central narrative, which cites an article published in the Motley Fool to determine that the average candidate gives at lower percentages than the average American in the same tax bracket. (The Motley Fool data groups everyone with an income of $250,000 or more into a single category and does not include donations as a percentage of earnings, which is understandable because the denominator for that calculation could vary from $250,000 to $250,000,000 or more.) Without more information about the giving habits of average Americans, I do not think the article and visualization can really prove this point satisfactorily. Instead, I would continue the visualization’s current focus of comparing the candidates to each other.

At the same time, there were a few aspects of the visualization that I wanted to experiment with. The current visualization is divided into two parts that cannot be viewed concurrently. One view shows total giving, the other shows total giving as a percent of earnings. The first is making the two graphics into one so that the viewer may more easily see differences between the two categories. Also, I would change the comparative size circles used to demonstrate differences in giving between candidates. The circles give some sense of the disparities between certain candidates, but it becomes difficult to distinguish size differences between candidates. (For example, Buttigieg’s $9,000 circle, though small, still seems too large relative to Tom Steyer’s $193,000,000 one.) Finally, viewers must cursor over each circle to see the relevant data. This makes it hard to compare candidates to one another. I would also provide a bit more contextual information to round out what the visualization is (and is not) saying. For example, the current visualization has a different number of candidates represented for total giving as opposed to giving as a percent of earnings. Although the article emphasizes that the data it is comparing for percent of earnings only applies to candidates who disclose their tax returns, it fails to mention that these candidates are included in one part of the graphic but not the others. I would address this explicitly and in the same spatial vicinity of the chart to clarify that not all candidates can be included in the visualization because not all of them have released their tax returns. Another aspect of context that I felt was lacking was a baseline comparison for giving. This could take the form of the donation amount and percentage of earnings of the “average American.” This is, however, certainly a “big ask” in the sense that such data may be complicated to calculate because there are many considerations involved. For example, should the “average American” be an overall calculation, or should it be segmented by different earnings groups? Should candidates be compared only to Americans in their tax brackets? A brief Google search showed that finding a singular number for this purpose is not easy.

I started by drafting a series of very basic sketches that took a few different approaches to visualizing the data. After working on these, I selected the two that I felt were strongest. The first was a graph with two y-axes, one for the total amount of contributions and the other for contributions as a percent of total earnings. The second, which I found more promising, graphed candidates as points with contributions as a percent of total earnings on the x-axis and total contributions on the y-axis. I experimented further with this design using Tableau, especially with how to address points of candidates who had not disclosed the necessary information to calculate contributions as a percent of earnings, who had dropped out of the race, or both.

I met with Matt in Office Hours to get some feedback on my original ideas, and he provided good insight on some of the issues I was having with visualizing outliers and how to consider the overall context of the visualization in my critique. One of the key pieces of feedback I received from him was to clarify explicitly that some of the omitted candidates had not disclosed the tax information necessary to calculate their contributions as a percent of earnings. This could include a caption, particularly because one of these candidates (Tom Steyer) had a total dollar amount of contributions that would have been about 138 times as large as the next closest candidate (Joe Biden). I also consulted with my roommate to get her perspective as a cold reader on the wireframes. She provided helpful feedback on what was clearest about the proposed design and what nuances needed to be clarified, which helped me identify what needed to be emphasized moving forward. One aspect that she highlighted was the importance of seeing data on the full field of candidates at once, which was one of the changes that I had made from the original design.

I used Tableau to develop the proposed redesign further, incorporating the provided feedback to clarify the graph and then making cosmetic adjustments. This included the use of ColorBrewer to obtain a 12-class, categorical color scheme, which, although I edited it slightly to darken the yellow, was very helpful as a tool to make the distinct candidates identifiable. I ultimately opted for outlined, rather than shaded, circles because so many of the data points at the 1% and 2% lines were congregated close together.

This overlap created a dilemma in which two of the candidates were actually obscured almost completely at the 1% and 2% marks, and others were very close together. I thought about using a break for Joe Biden's point because his dollar amount of donations was much higher than all of the other candidates. In the course of reviewing results about how to do this on Tableau, I saw a recommendation for William Cleveland's work on full breaks. Long story short(ish), I ended up in a rabbit hole of information on suggestions for portraying this type of data. Through a [blog by Tom Hopper](https://tomhopper.me/2010/08/30/graphing-highly-skewed-data/), I was introduced to Ed Tufte's "small multiples" concept, which involves creating a full visualization that encompasses all points followed by secondary graphs that "zoom in" on certain portions of the visualizations for clarification. That suggestion led me to the two-graphic approach I use here. The full visualization demonstrates that giving among candidates, though variable in dollar amount, was generally similar when calculated as a portion of earnings. The additional graph with the narrower focus allows for comparison across candidates whose values were more obscured in the broader graph.

# About Me
She/her/hers  
I am a second-year PPM student with a concentration in Policy Analysis. Prior to coming to Heinz, I studied history, economics, and business, and worked in public history for two cultural institutions. As part of my coursework prior to Heinz, I worked with five other students to draft and help pass legislation to address issues that museums and other entities faced regarding abandoned cultural property. This made me interested in developing evidence-based policy solutions and evaluating current policies, which led me to Heinz last fall. This summer, I worked at the U.S. Government Accountability Office on the Financial Markets and Community Investment team. I plan to continue working in policy analysis and program evaluation following graduation.

# What I Hope to Learn
I'm hoping that this class will provide me with a foundation of general principles for data visualization to demonstrate the fundamental factors and "best practices" in the field. In addition to these "guidelines," I hope the class will provide me with a sense of the possibilities for data visualization that will allow me to go beyond the types of graphics I have used in the past. I'm hoping I develop an improved intuition for creating effective data visualizations and evaluating existing graphics to help improve them.
